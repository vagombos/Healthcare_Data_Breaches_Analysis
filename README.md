### Statement of Business Task
Cybersecurity is important across domains, but the U.S. healthcare industry is particularly vulnerable, with many cybercriminal attacks in the last decade trying to take advantage of medical facilities' high stakes data for extortion.[^1] The current business task is to conduct an exploratory analysis, to find patterns and potential avenues for further inquiry, into one element of cybersecurity risk that criminals may take advantage of: breaches of unsecured protected health information.

### Description of Data Source
This open public data source is provided by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) in accordance with section 13402(e)(4) of the HITECH Act (https://ocrportal.hhs.gov/ocr/breach/breach_report.jsf).
The data range selected included cases currently under investigation, from July 19, 2021 to August 10, 2023.
